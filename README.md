# A test task from [Natera](natera.com)
## Simple Graph lib:

1. Should support 2 types of graphs - directed and undirected with 3 operations:
   + addVertex - adds vertex to the graph
   + addEdge - adds edge to the graph
   + getPath - returns a list of edges between 2 vertices (path doesn’t have to be optimal)
1. Vertices should be of a user defined type.
1. Questions to be ready to answer (don’t have to implement):
    + Add weighted edges support in your lib.
    + Add traverse function that will take a user defined function and apply it on every vertex of the graph.
1. Make you graphs thread safe.
